# Supported languages

What does it mean that a language is "supported" by QVM? Doesn't it support ***ALL*** languages?

The answer is yes, QVM supports ***ALL*** languages which can be compiled to a static ELF binary compatible with Linux.
However, there is a continously expanding list of languages officially supported by QANplatform development team.

This means that for these languages there will be official tutorials and optimized compilers made available to ensure that contracts written in these languages run as efficient as possible and consume as little fees as absolutely required, nothing more.

## The current list of supported languages:
