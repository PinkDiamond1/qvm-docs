# V0.0.2

## New features

- Expose DB key+value pairs as environment variables to the execution context
- Design common STDIO based API easily accessible from any language to interact with QVM
- Enable forwarding STDERR/STDOUT to be emitted as events
- Cryptographically provable contract download & registration
- ASCII encoders for DB read/write

## Limitations

- Database keys and values are limited to 32 bytes
- Database keys and values can be only ASCII encoded
- STDIO of contract execution result is limited to 32 bytes
- Events cannot be emitted by contracts
- Exit codes of contract binaries are not persisted
- Fixed QVM memory allocation
- Storage of other contracts cannot be accessed
- Architecture is distributed, but not truly decentralized yet
- Various instructions do not have proper economics behind them
- Royalty features are not yet implemented
- Value transfers (transferring rETH from QVM) instructions not ready yet

## Roadmap to v0.0.3

- Write ERC20 equivalent contract sample in Go
- Lift limitation of DB keys and values length
- Lift limitation of STDIO length
